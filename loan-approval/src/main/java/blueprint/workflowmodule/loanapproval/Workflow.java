 * What the application tells the process: the outgoing half of the BPMN wiring.

 * <p>
 * {@link Service} calls in, naming what happened in business terms ({@code loanRequested}),
 * and this class translates that into whatever the process needs: starting a workflow,
 * correlating a message, completing a task. {@link ProcessService} is injected here and
 * nowhere else.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Name the methods after the business event, never after the BPMN element, so
 * {@code loanRequested} and not {@code correlateLoanRequestedMessage}. The model may be
 * remodelled, a message may become a timer, and the business code must not notice.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The incoming half, what the process tells the application, is
 * {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}. Keeping the two directions in two classes is what keeps the
 * dependencies acyclic: this class is used by {@link Service}, the other one uses it.
